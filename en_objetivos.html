	<li style="list-style:none;">Located in the outskirts and to the southeast of this great metropolis, it is composed of 44 families in which one or various members suffer from leprosy. During the past few years, there have been great investments in hours and effort, to provide them with better quality of life  through workshops focused in consolidating social-economical and gender matters as well as enhancing their economic independence and settling values that can strengthen the role of  women in the Indian Society.

	<li style="list-style:none;">Situated in a suburb on the northern area of Bangalore, it shelters 35 kids, belonging to families with members suffering from leprosy or no economic resources. In this childcare center, we start from the early age to show this new generation some fundamental values, as well as the need to respect  the world that surrounds them and to reinforce in an active way their aptitudes, attitudes and their motor skills. All of this is done in a playful environment, always improving our center with the support of the three staff members that live in the same area. At the end of children’s kindergarten age, we continue to assure all our students private primary education.</li>
