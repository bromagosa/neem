<h2>Welcome friends!</h2>
<span>The integral project of A.NEEM Bangalore takes place in the suburbs of Chikkanayakanahalli, Indirapuram and Shanti Nilayan, in the city of Bangalore, capital of the state of Karnataka, located in the south western zone of the India. In the last decade, Bangalore has become one of the world’s industrial centers of high technology, information and communication. Due to the creation of job offers, the massive influx of people to the city has generated nucleus of social isolation in the city center as well  as in the periphery. </span>
<span>Nearly 3 million people of the 12 million inhabitants of Bangalore and surrounding areas live in poverty and 1,350,000 people live in extreme poverty.</span>
<span>In the year 2004, the government of the metropolitan area of Bangalore prohibited  begging in the streets, the only source of income to the disable and the leprosy infected ones. Then, a  program of physical displacement started, moving the most marginal and impoverished, from the city of Bangalore towards new suburbs known as "slums".</span>
<span>Among these displaced people are the leprosy infected and their families, that have to  trust in the solidarity and generosity of the humanitarian and development organizations  that work in "slums", once the government does not provide them with anything but a small ration of monthly food by means of a rationing letter .</span>
<span>The needy situation of these  people  is considerable since, being physically limited by their illness, rejected and illiterate,  they stand no chance to be part of the modern and changeable society.</span>
